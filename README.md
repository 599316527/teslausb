Steps and scripts for turning a Raspberry Pi into a useful USB drive for a Tesla.

This repo contains scripts originally from this thread on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9m9gyk/build_a_smart_usb_drive_for_your_tesla_dash_cam/

Many people in that thread suggested that the scripts be hosted on Github but the author didn't seem interested in making that happen.

I've hosted the scripts here with his/her permission.
